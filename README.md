# Get It Together

**Check the game out at Itch!**... when it gets finished ;p

Small exploration game in which a ship (the player) must collect its lost modules and parts after a comet crashes onto it.

Developed on Unity 2019.4.2f1.

The game was initially intended to be submitted to the GMTK Game Jam 2020,
but it was decided that it could be better finished if more time was put into it.
Basically it is a tad bit larger than the time constraint we had to work with.
